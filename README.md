## ðŸ”¹ Challenge

Managing online news articles is often difficult without a structured system. News editors need to:

Create categories (e.g., Sports, Politics, Technology).

Add and update news articles with details like title, description, and images.

Manage users who post the news.

Soft delete and restore news when needed.


Without a proper system, all of this can be messy and unorganized.
